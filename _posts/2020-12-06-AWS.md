EC2 is one of the most popular AWS offering. It provides the capabilities of:
* Renting Virtual Machines (EC2)
* Storing data on the virtual drives (EBS)
* Distributing load across machine (ELB)
* Scaling a service using auto-scaling group (ASG)

## ssh to the instance

**Note: Ensure write permission to certificate file (chmod 400 certificate_file)**

Using certificate location with CLI

```
ssh -i ~/certificates/aws.pem ec2user@ec2-instance-url
```

Alternative add the configuration to `~/.ssh/config`

```
Host my-aws-instance
     Hostname ec2-instance-url
     User ec2user
     IdentityFile ~/certificates/aws.pem
```

Now use the **Host** name to ssh

```
ssh my-aws-instance
```

## User Data

It is possible to bootstrap the instance using **user data** script. *Bootstrapping* means launching commands when a machine starts. This script runs only once at the instance first start. It is used to automate boot tasks (e.g. Installing updates, Installing softwares, download common files etc.)

# Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

**AMI is what EC2 instance is based of**

AWS comes with *base images* such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Windows etc. These images can be customized at runtime using *EC2 user data*. You can create your own image from the instance known as custom built AMIs.

Custom built AMIs have the following advantages:
* Pre-installed packages as needed
* Faster boot time (no need for EC2 user data at boot time)
* Comes with monitoring / enterprise software
* Control of maintenance and upgrade of AMIs over time
* Active Directory Integration out of the box
* Installed app for faster deployment (auto-scaling)
* Using someone else AMIs that is optimized for DB, app etc.

**Note: AMIs are built for specific AWS region.**

# Choosing the right Instance Type

Instances have 5 characteristics advertized on the website:
* RAM (type, amount, generation)
* CPU (type, make, frequency, generation, number of cores)
* IO (disk performance, EBS optimizations)
* Network (network bandwidth, network latency)
* GPU

There are other two categories:
* General Instance (M)
* Burstable Instance (T2)

Refer to [Amazon website](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types) to choose the right instance carefully.

# Network and Security

## Security Groups

Security groups acts like a firewall on your EC2 instances. They regulate:
* Access to ports
* Autorized or forbidden IP (ranges) — IPv4 and IPv6
* Control of inbound network
* Control of outbound network

![image-center]({{ '/images/security_groups.png' | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

* One security Group can be attached to multiple instances
* Security group is locked down to a region/VPC combination
* Security group live “outside” EC2 instance — if traffic is blocked EC2 instance does not see it.
* All **inbound** traffic is **blocked** by default.
* All **outbound** traffic is **authorized** by default.

## Elastic IPs

An elastic IP is a public IPv4 address which is reserved for your instance. By default, public IP address of instance is not reserved and can change across reboots. One elastic IP is attached to only one instance.

Elastic IP is used to mask the failure of instance by remapping the IP address to another instance of same type.

```
Avoid Elastic IPs. Instead use DNS.... even better use load balancer so that there is no need of using instance public IP.
```

## Placement Groups

Placement groups provides strategies for placement of EC2 instances. Using placement groups, you can specify one of the following strategy:
* **Cluster** — clusters instances into low latency group in a single Availability Zone (AZ)
* **Spread** — spreads instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ)

```Placement groups are not applicable for t2 instances.```

# Load balancers

There are three types of load balancers

## Classic Load Balancer

Many AWS users are still using classic load balancers. They are great to learn the basic concept of load balancing bare are not recommended to use.

![image-center]({{ '/images/aws_lb.png' | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

## Application Load Balancer (Layer 7)

* Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups)
* Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine (ex: containers)
* Load balancing based on route in URL
* Load balancing based on hostname in URL

Basically, they are awesome for micro-services & container-based application (example: *Docker*). In comparison, we would have to create one Classic Load Balancer per application before, which was very expensive and inefficient.

![image-center]({{ '/images/aws_lb_layer7.png' | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

## Network Load Balancer (Layer 4)

* Forward TCP traffic to your instances
* Handles millions of request per second
* Support for static IP or elastic IP
* Less latency ~100 ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)

Network Load Balancers are used for extreme performance and should not be the default network load balancer to use.

# Auto Scaling Application

```Automate your application```

The goal of Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is to:
* Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match increased load
* Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match decreased load
* Ensure minimum and maximum number of machines running
* Automatically register new instances to load balancer

ASGs have the following attributes:
* Launch Configuration (AMI + Instance type, EC2 user data, EBS volumes, Security groups, SSH key pair)
* Min Size / Max Size / Launch Capacity
* Network + Subnet Information
* Scaling Policies

![image-center]({{ '/images/aws_asg.png' | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

## Auto Scaling Rules

It is now possible to define auto scaling rules that are directly managed by EC2 based on:
* Average CPU Usage
* Number of requests on the ELB per instance
* Average Network In
* Average Network Out

These rules are easier to setup and makes more sense.

# Elastic Block Store (EBS)

Store data durably

## EBS Volume

EC2 machine loses its root volume when it is terminated but sometimes, you need to store instance data.

An EBS Volume is a network drive that can be attached to the instances when they run. It allows instances to persist data. Main features of EBS volume are:
* It’s a **network drive** — hence there may be latency. On positive side, it can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly.
* It’s **Locked to an availability zone** — To move, it needs to be snapshot first.
* It has a **provisioned capacity** (GBs / IOPS) — Billed for the provisioned capacity.

There are four types of EBS volume:

Details can be found at: [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html)

## EBS Snapshots

* EBS Volumes can be backed up using “snapshots”
* Snapshots only take the actual space of the blocks on the volume. If you snapshot 1 TB drive that has 50 GB data, then snapshot will be 50 GB only.
* EBS snapshot lives in *Amazon* S3
* Snapshots are used for **backups** and **volume migration** (resizing volume down, changing volume type, changing availability zone).

# EC2 Instances Run Modes

```Optimize EC2 usage for cost```

There are four type of instances:
* On Demand Instances
* Reserved Instances
* Spot Instances
* Dedicated hosts
