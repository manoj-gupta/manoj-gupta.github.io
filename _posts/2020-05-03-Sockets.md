# Introduction
Sockets are the preferred way of network communication. They are  provided by Operating Systems as socket API, which are based on the principles of reading and writing files.

A program gets a socket using OS provided  API. Socket API returns a socket descriptor (integer value) similar to the *Read* and *Write* Operations on files. This socket descriptor is used to write or read data from the socket. The data written to the socket is encapsulated by the operating system by adding network layer headers and trailers before sending via the network interface to the target host. The received data from the socket is presented to the program without the headers and trailers, only the user data is presented to the user. These sockets are called *DATAGRAM-sockets* (UDP based) or *STREAM-sockets* (TCP based) provided via the Berkeley socket API. For these two types of sockets, user is unaware of the communication between the lower layers. The user is only responsible for creating the socket and then providing the data that needs to be sent.

To gain access to the data of the lower layers, there are other options: *RAW-sockets*, *PACKET-sockets*, network drivers and Data Link layer APIs. With these APIs it is possible for an application to change and access the fields of the Network layers that are used for sending the data.
